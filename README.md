# Trace the Treasure Game

Welcome to the "Trace the Treasure" game! In this basic text-based game, your goal is to find the hidden treasure on a 10x10 grid using a limited number of clicks. This README will guide you through the rules of the game and how to run it.

## Game Rules

1. **Boiling Hot (Distance 30):** When you are very close to the treasure, you'll receive the message "Boiling Hot."

2. **Really Hot (Distance 40):** As you move a bit further away from the treasure but still very close, you'll be informed that you're "Really Hot."

3. **Hot (Distance 60):** When you're getting warmer but not too close, the message will indicate that you're "Hot."

4. **Warm (Distance 100):** At a moderate distance, you'll be told that you're "Warm."

5. **Cold (Distance 180):** When you're far from the treasure, you'll be notified that you're "Cold."

6. **Really Cold (Distance 360):** As you move even further from the treasure, you'll receive the message "Really Cold."
